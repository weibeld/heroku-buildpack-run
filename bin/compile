#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# This buildpack can be used for executing custom commands on the build dyno.
# All the Bash commands in buildpack-run.sh will be run during the execution of
# the 'compile' script. The working dir for the script will be the root app dir.
#
# ---
#
# The 'compile' script is executed by the slug compiler with three arguments:
#   $1: build_dir, location of your app directory on the build dyno
#   $2: cache_dir, directory on the build dyno that persists between builds
#   $3: env_dir, directory holding all the app's config vars as files

# Source commands in buildpack-run.sh (i.e. the commmands in buildpack-run.sh
# are executed in the current shell, not in a new shell as it would be the case
# if buildpack-run.sh was a script). The build can be aborted with 'exit 1'.
