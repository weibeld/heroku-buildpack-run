#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# This buildpack can be used for executing custom commands on the build dyno.
# All the Bash commands in buildpack-run.sh will be run during the execution of
# the 'compile' script. The working dir for the script will be the root app dir.
#
# ---
#
# The 'compile' script is executed by the slug compiler with three arguments:
#   1. build_dir: location of your app directory on the build dyno
#   2. cache_dir: directory on the build dyno that persists between builds
#   3. env_dir:   directory holding all the app's config vars as files
#
